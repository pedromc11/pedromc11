# 👋 Hi there, I'm Pedro Mena!

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I’m a passionate technology enthusiast, always eager to explore new ideas and turn them into meaningful experiences. I enjoy working on ambitious and creative projects that challenge me to grow, think differently, and keep learning every day.

I believe in collaboration, innovation, and adaptability — whether it’s building something from scratch, joining a dynamic team, or simply learning something new on my own.

Currently, I’m working on my personal portfolio (still under development), where you’ll soon find a more detailed biography, some of my favorite projects, and insights into what drives me as a developer and creator.

## 🌐 Contact Me

I'm always open to new opportunities, connections, and meaningful conversations. Feel free to reach out!
